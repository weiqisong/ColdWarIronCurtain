 prc_rework.20.d:0 "After the chaos of the student movement in Beijing subsided, observers and democracy activists in various countries have been surprised to find that the movement did not end like other demonstrations in authoritarian states. The military police would not brutally suppress it, and violence would be kept to a minimum. Instead, senior leaders of the CPC walked into the students and listened to their demands. Martial law was lifted and residents' lives returned to normal. At the same time, a major shift has occurred within the CPC. Senior officials who support repression have been forced to retire or have been demoted. \nIt is reported that Deng Xiaoping has been sent home to "recuperate" and the liberals, led by Zhao Ziyang, have taken the reigns of power. Sweeping Westernizing reforms have been announced and large scale political liberalization has begun. It is likely that China will seek support from the United States in it's endeavours. "

#在北京由学生运动引起的混乱退潮后，国际观察家和各国民主人士惊奇的发现，这场运动不像是发生在韩国或是世界上其他威权政府的运动一样，以军警的血腥镇压结束。
#相反，中共的高级领导人走进学生中，倾听他们提出的要求。曾经颁布的戒严令被解除，居民生活重归正常。同时中共内部也发生了一次严重的政治地震。看上去赞同镇压的领导人被强迫退休或是降级，据悉邓小平已被送至家中“休养”。这次，以赵紫阳为首的中共自由派占了上风。他们宣布将会进行一系列民主改革以适应世界潮流，并宣称中国将会以一张全新的面貌来应对后冷战时代的种种挑战。大规模的言论“解冻”已经在进行。很可能中国将与美国寻求进一步接触。
