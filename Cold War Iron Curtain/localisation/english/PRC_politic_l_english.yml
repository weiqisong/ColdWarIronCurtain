 #Government support: Government support means that people's trust in our government will be weakened by major emergencies and mismanagement. If people no longer trust us, we will fall into the Tacitus trap and our orders will be ignored!The authority of the Party: The authority of the Party is used to reflect the status of the ruling party in the hearts of the masses. The higher the status is, the greater the influence of the discourse of the ruling party members in the society is, and vice versa.Government efficiency: The more efficient our civil servants are, the more they can handle government on their own, and the more they can carry out what is given to them.Degree of government redundancy: if there are too many civil servants, there will naturally be a shift of responsibility, a decline in efficiency, and the costs they require will be equally large. Too few and our civilian staff will not be able to handle their assignments on time.Social solidarity: Differences in productive labor lead to differences between classes within classes. When such differences are infinitely magnified, distrust and alienation between people will be generated, which will lead to hatred and discrimination. When the gaps between different types of people are bridged, they will unite to achieve great things.
